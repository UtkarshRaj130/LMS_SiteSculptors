                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
                        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
                        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage.<br/>
